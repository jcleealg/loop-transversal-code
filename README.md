# Loop Transversal Code


This repository provides tools for constructing and presenting syndrome maps in greedy loop transversal codes, as part of the Master's thesis "Loop Transversal Code".

## Online Loop Transversal Code Explorer

An interactive web-based version of the Loop Transversal Code tool is available:

ðŸ‘‰ **[Loop Transversal Code Explorer](https://jcleealg.github.io/loop-transversal-code/)**

Use this web app to explore syndrome mappings and parity check matrices directly in your browser. No installation requiredâ€”just open the link and start experimenting with different error patterns and code parameters.

## Project Overview
Traditional error-correcting codes are designed first, then analyzed to determine which errors they can correct. In contrast, the Loop Transversal Code method starts with a list of errors you want to fix, and uses a greedy algorithm to build a custom code tailored to that list. This project demonstrates the greedy construction process and provides CLI tools for exploring syndrome mappings and parity check matrices.

## Reference
This project is based on the following Master's thesis:
- [Loop Transversal Code (NCKU Thesis Library)](https://thesis.lib.ncku.edu.tw/thesis/detail/4759066580a6172d56505500348dae66/)

## Main Features
- `full-syndrome-mapping`: Display syndrome mappings for all error patterns.
- `basis-mapping`: Display syndrome mappings for basis vectors.
- `parity-check-matrix`: Output the parity check matrix.
- `all-mapping`: Run all three features in sequence.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Typer-based CLI for syndrome mapping and parity check matrix generation.
- `greedy_syndrome_mapper.py`: Core greedy algorithm implementation.
- `tests/`: Pytest test cases for main features.
- `archive/GLTC_presentation.py`: Demo script for parity-check matrix construction (archived draft).
- `archive/tools.py`: Early prototype of the greedy algorithm (archived, for reference only).
- `src_cpp/`: A C++ implementation of the core logic with an interactive CLI.

## C++ Version

A C++ version of the core logic is available in the `src_cpp/` directory. It provides an interactive command-line interface for the same greedy algorithm.

For detailed build and usage instructions, please see the **[C++ README](./src_cpp/README.md)**.

## Installation
Install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Usage
```powershell
# Example 1: Simple basis
python main.py all-mapping --error-patterns "[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]"

# Example 2: Custom error patterns
python main.py all-mapping --error-patterns "[[0,0,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0,0]]"

# Example 3: Standard basis
python main.py parity-check-matrix --standard-basis 3
```

When running the .exe by double-clicking, only one command can be executed per launch due to Windows console behavior. The program will exit after the command completes.
For persistent interactive CLI (multiple commands in one session), please run the .exe from a command prompt (cmd or PowerShell).


## How to Test

To run all tests and verify the core logic, use:
```bash
pytest
```
This will automatically discover and execute all test cases in the `tests/` folder. Make sure all dependencies are installed before running tests.

## Typer CLI Autocompletion

This CLI supports command and option autocompletion for a smoother user experience.

**Install autocompletion** (run once):
```powershell
python main.py --install-completion
```
After running, follow the instructions to add the output to your shell profile (PowerShell, bash, zsh, etc.).

**Show autocompletion script**:
```powershell
python main.py --show-completion
```
Use this to manually copy or customize the installation.

Once installed, you can use the tab key to autocomplete commands and options when typing `python main.py` in your terminal.

## Archive

The `archive/` folder contains early drafts and prototype scripts from the initial development phase. These files are preserved for reference and historical context, but are not maintained or recommended for direct use.
